:warning: This is code is very weekend-warrior and hacked together. It barely works. But it does work. Anyway - use with discretion.

## What does it do?

Ribbot will respond to commands that include reddit links and proceed to download, and upload the video associated with the link, if any.

example command:

```user41039: r/https://reddit.com/r/TikTokCringe/comments/31jfk3/Some-Post-Title/```
